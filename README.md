# TIC TAC TOE GAME - PYTHON

## Introduction:
This project is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe, developed as part of our programming class. The objective was to apply the basic programming concepts we've learned to create a playable game. This README aims to guide you through the game's features and the concepts applied.

## Game Features:
- **Customizable Player Symbols**: Players can choose their preferred symbol ('X' or 'O') at the beginning of the game. The second player automatically receives the remaining symbol.
- **Three Rounds of Play**: Allowing players multiple opportunities to win.
- **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of each player's victories across the rounds and declares an overall winner at the end.
- **Player Turns**: Player 1 always starts the game, and players alternate turns.
- **Win and Tie Detection**: The game checks for a win or tie after each move and ends the round accordingly.

## Concepts Applied from Class:
- **Loops**: Used to iterate through the rows and columns of the game board and to control the flow of the game rounds.
- **Conditionals**: Applied to determine the game's state, such as checking for a win, a tie, or validating player input.
- **Lists**: Used to create the 3x3 game board and manage the symbols for each player.
- **Functions**: The game's functionality is broken down into multiple functions for better organization and readability.
- **Dictionaries**: To track the scores and assign the symbols.
- **Error handling**: For invalid moves.

## How to Play:
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Run the game in your Python environment.
- When prompted, Player 1 chooses their symbol ('X' or 'O').
- Follow the on-screen instructions to choose the row and column for your move.
- Play through the rounds, and the game will display the winner at the end.
